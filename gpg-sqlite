# Usage: gpg-sqlite FILE [RECIPIENT]
#
# gpg-sqlite allows a user to edit a SQLite 3 database encrypted with GnuPG. The
# following steps are taken:
#
# 1. A temporary copy is made of the file to be edited with the owner set to
#    the invoking user.
# 2. The SQLirte 3 command-line interface sqlite3(1) is run to edit the
#    temporary file.
# 3. Whether or not it has been modified, the temporary file is re-encrypted
#    with GnuPG and returned to its original location and the temporary file is
#    removed.
#

  # shred and remove the temporary, unencrypted file
  shred -u "$TEMPDIR/$BN.$$"
  # remove the temporary output; probably don't need to shred, as it's encrypted
  rm -f "$TEMPDIR/$BN"
}

# First and only argument is (or should be) the file to edit.
