# Usage: gpg-edit FILE [RECIPIENT]
#
# gpg-edit allows a user to edit a file encrypted with GnuPG. The following
# steps are taken:
#
# 1. A temporary copy is made of the file to be edited with the owner set to
#    the invoking user.
# 2. The Debian 'sensible-editor' is run to edit the temporary file. See also
#    sensible-editor(1) and select-editor(1).
# 3. If it has been modified, the temporary file is re-encrypted with GnuPG and
#    returned to its original location and the temporary file is removed.
#

# First and only argument is (or should be) the file to edit.
