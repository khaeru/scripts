To use these scripts:

$ cd ~
$ bzr branch lp:~khaeru/+junk/scripts .local/bin

In ~/.profile, replace:

  # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
  if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
  fi

...with:

  # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
  if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  fi

This hides the directory containing the scripts from most views
of your home directory, but leaves the scripts accessible.

You can also do the following to ease updates:

$ bzr bind lp:~khaeru/+junk/scripts .local/bin

... after which the code may be updated with:

$ bzr update .local/bin
